# East West University Network Design Project

## Introduction
This project aims to design and implement a network using Cisco Packet Tracer for East West University. The network covers 15 departments with at least 75 devices, including laptops, printers, and smartphones.

## Network Topology
We utilized the Star topology to design the network for East West University, which comprises 15 departments with 75 devices, including laptops, printers, and smartphones. The network comprises a central switch that connects to all other devices in a hub-and-spoke manner, with each department having its own switch that connects to the central switch.

In addition, we incorporated access points with wireless connections to the smartphones, enabling seamless network access. The network comprises three servers - DNS, DHCP, and Web Server - with static IP addresses assigned to them, connected to the central switch. This topology enabled efficient and effective network management, emphasizing the importance of proper network planning and the utilization of appropriate network management tools.

## Implementation
We utilized DHCP to assign IP addresses to the generic devices and smartphones, and ensured the three servers' static IPs were maintained. This implementation enabled efficient and effective network management, emphasizing the importance of proper network planning and the utilization of appropriate network management tools.
